# Homework 2

This homework is an example of a portfolio page I might have as a web developer.  It allows the user to navigate to different pages and enter text in a form, though there is no functionality to the form.

It is built using Bootstrap's responsive features to allow different appearances on different screen sizes.

## Acknowledgements

This web page relies heavily on Bootstrap's built in css and Java frameworks.  The original code I created was minimal.


## Status

Although this is a work in progress, I will likely elect to redo the webpage when I gain more practice using these tools.
